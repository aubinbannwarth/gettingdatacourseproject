# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the repository for the course project in the *Getting and Cleaning Data* class on Coursera.

The project consisted of creating two tidy data sets from the data set available at the [this website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

In this repository, you will find:

* This *README.md* file.
* The R script *run_analysis.R* that was used to download and clean the data and generate the two tidy data sets.
* The *CodeBook.md* file, that explains the code in *run_analysis.R* step by step and provides additional information about
the variable names, the two new data sets, and our overall approach.
* An R Markdown file *CodeBook.Rmd* that was used to generate the Markdown file *CodeBook.md*
* The two tidy datasets *human_activity.csv* and *human_activity_means.csv*.
